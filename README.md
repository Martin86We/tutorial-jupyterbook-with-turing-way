## Title: Creating a Jupyter Book with The Turing Way

- Audience level: Novice
- Prerequisite: previous experience with version control, GitHub
- Target Audience: Anyone with prior knowledge of using GitHub for project repositories. Basic experience working with Markdown files and Jupyter notebook will be a plus. 

**Summary:**
- Jupyter Book is an open source project for building publication-ready books with computational files. The Turing Way is a community-led book project on learning computational skills, which is hosted online as a Jupyter Book. In this tutorial, you will learn about the collaborative nature of both the projects and create your own book using files and chapters from The Turing Way as examples.

**Outline:**
List of topics and activities:
- The workshop will start by introducing the importance of reproducibility in research.
- The session leads will then present The Turing Way as a community-developed book project that teaches best practices in data science for research reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration and ethics.
- The project's workflow of creating Jupyter Book will be introduced as an example of the reproducible way for hosting online books
- A demo of The Turing Way's GitHub repository will explain how a Jupyter book is created and how they are hosted online
- A longer hands-on session will be carried out to create Jupyter Book on GitHub, using The Turing Way chapters and files if your interest as examples
- We will further show how to deploy JupyterBook with continuous integration tests using github actions
- We will show the collaborative workflow to collaborate on GitHub and propose edits on Jupyter Book
- Breakout sessions will be used for demo and troubleshooting from the participants in small groups
- The session will end with open Q&A and sharing details on how participants can gain further support when working with Jupyter Books and The Turing Way

**Proposed Agenda:**

-  5 minutes: Introduction to the workshop
-  10 minutes: Icebreakers for the participants to get to know each other (breakout)
-  30 minutes: Introduction to The Turing Way and Jupyter Book projects
    -  What is Turing Way?
    -  What is Jupyter Book?
        -  An example: Netlify for hosting
-   15 minutes: Demo of The Turing Way GitHub repository and its Jupyter Book
    -   how does the repo look like (important bits: website folder, _toc file, config file)
-   10 minutes: what is CI? reproduciblity
-   70 minutes: Hands-on session on creating a Jupyter Book on GitHub that will include the following:
    -   Set up repo
    -   add important chapters
    -   config file
    -   Jupyter Notebook
    -   toc file
    -   jupyterBook in Binder (without CI)
    -   add CI action and deploy the Jupyter Book using continuous integration tests of GitHub actions
    -   add more chapters from the Turing Way
    -   update toc
    -   deploy with CI
-   20 minutes: Closing demo using Sphinx features in Jupyter Book (for cross-referencing, citation, etc.), pdf, working with the collaborative workflow on GitHub repository to edit a chapter or propose edits on Jupyter Book
-   20 minutes: Open Q&A, Wrap-up and shared reflection on the workshop
