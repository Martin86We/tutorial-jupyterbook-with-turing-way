    "\n",
    "- In this module, using examples from *The Turing Way*, we discussed useful features that provides easy navigation and collaboration in Jupyter Book.\n",
    "- We can add bibtex citation of external resources in the `references.bib`, and cite them in the book chapters using the ``{cite}`CITEKEY` ``, where CITEKEY is the corresponding citation key in references.bib.\n",
    "- We can create labels for different headers or chapters, subchapters and sections in each file (using `(label-name)=`) to cross reference them in the different chapters within the book (using ``{ref}`label-name` ``).\n",
    "- Jupyter Book provides a collaborative interface for users to contribute to the book by using its GitHub integration to read a chapter online and suggest edits to those by visiting them on its GitHub repository.\n",
    "- There are many advanced features that make Jupyter Book an appropriate tool for *The Turing Way* to maintain and develop its resources in a community-led and collaborative manner.\n",
