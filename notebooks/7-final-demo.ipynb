    "\n",

    "For example, see the `overview.md` file in the `book/overview` folder, where a label `rr-overview` have been created by adding `(rr-overview=)` before the top header is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Here, \"rr\" is used as an abbreviation for Reproducible Research, and \"overview\" is the chpater name.\n",
    "However, there is not hard guideline for what names can be used for creating such labels.\n",

    "Other subchapters have a similar label named: `rr-overview-definitions`, `rr-overview-benefits` and `rr-overview-resources`.\n",

    "🗝 Takeaway\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this module, using examples from *The Turing Way*, we discussed useful features that provides easy navigation and collaboration in Jupyter Book.\n",
    "- We can add bibtex citation of external resources in the `references.bib`, and cite them in the book chapters using the {cite}`CITEKEY`, where CITEKEY is the corresponding citation key in references.bib.\n",
    "- We can create labels for different headers or chapters, subchapters and sections in each file (using `(label-name)=`) to cross reference them in the different chapters within the book (using `{ref}`label-name`).\n",
    "- Jupyter Book provides a collaborative interface for users to contribute to the book by using its GitHub integration to read a chapter online and suggest edits to those by visiting them on GitHub repository.\n",
    "- There are many advanced features that make Jupyter Book as an appropriate tool for *The Turing Way* to maintain and develop its resources in a community-led and collaborative manner.\n",
