    "- Jupyter Book uses markdown files to create chapters of an online book. In this tutorial, these files are placed in a directory called `book`.\n",
    "- All the images used in the file should also be stored in `book` (we saved them under the folder `figures` in this tutorial).\n",
    "- References used in the book should be stored in a `references.bib` file, which should also be stored in `book`\n",
    "- A `_toc.yml` should be generated inside the folder `book` to structure the jupyter Book (toc is abbreviation for table of content)\n",
